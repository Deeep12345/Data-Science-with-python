# Image Captioning using Tensorflow

Image Embedding containing 4096 dimensionl feature vector from VGG-16 model was used for training
the model using Transfer learning. 
Another embedding layer was utilised to map 4096 dimensional image
features into the space of 256 dimensional textual features.
Multi-layer Long Short Term Memory model
was built .
Masking technique was used to handle variable length input.

# Comparison and Analysis of various Supervised classification ML models
Performance comparison of various data science models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Network (MLP Classifier) & Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes on the basis of Precision, Recall, F-1-Score, ROC-AUC curve using Mushrooms classification dataset.

# Principal Component Analysis
 Detailed step-by-step study of PCA without using Scikit-learn using dataset of Human Resources Analytics. Basic concepts such as covariance matrix, Eigen values and Eigen vectors was analysed.

# Detail-analysis-of-Support-Vector-Machine
Detail study of SVM using dataset of Gender Recognition by voice, by comparing the default model with further tuned model. Various hyper-parameters such as kernel, C & gamma were tuned.

# Data Visualisation of IPL statistics
Visualization of important stats were produced using Matplotlib and Seaborn library to analyse the trend and generate insights. Important stats included highest run getters, Toss-Win factor, total matches played-won factor, Most wins by big margin(Greater than 50 runs or more than 8 wickets)by teams etc.
